  content: "I'm going on my third son looking to play college ball. This app has made the process so much cleaner than in past years. I love being able to go to a tournament and instantly see all the details about a potential college. My son is a 3.3ish GPA student so why waste time if a school needs higher. And that's just the tip of the iceberg with these guys."

- title: "The Future of College Athletics"
  content: "When it comes to college athletics AllTeamz has cornered the market. In the past sites like MaxPreps helped colleges scout good talent, but it was hard for talented players to find good colleges. With Baseball Bound this has become easier than ever. I can see what grades are expected of me, what it's going to cost me to attend, and most importantly I have an avenue to expose my talents."
